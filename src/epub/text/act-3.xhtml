			</h2>
			<p>The same room. Morning, before the rehearsal. <b>He</b> is striding thoughtfully up and down the room. He wears a broad, parti-coloured coat, and a prismatic tie. His derby is on the back of his head, and his face is clean-shaven like that of an actor. His eyebrows are drawn, lips pressed together energetically, his whole appearance severe and sombre. After the entrance of the gentleman he changes. His face becomes clown-like, mobile⁠—a living mask.</p>
			<p>The gentleman comes in. <b>He</b> is dressed in black, and has an extremely well-bred appearance. His thin face is yellowish, like an invalid’s. When he is upset, his colourless, dull eyes often twitch. <b>He</b> does not notice him.</p>

And then your career is made, as Jackson says. And wherever I go, the whole street looks at me with thousands of faces, in which⁠—what mockery⁠—I recognize the traits of my own children. Oh!

A notary public is always present at your thefts. What is the use of this self-torture, my friend? Get married. I died. You are not satisfied with having taken only my wife? Let my glory remain in your possession. It is yours. Accept my ideas. Assume all the rights, my most lawful heir! I died!
